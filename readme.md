Statically typed language is of a variable type known as compile time. Here, one has to specify what type each variable is.Examples; C, C++, Java, Rust, Scala, Go. While Dynamically typed language is associated with run-time values and not named variables etc. Here, one doesn't have to specify types of variables everytime. Examples; Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang.

Null is an assigned value. It means nothing. While Undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
